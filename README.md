# Project: Hotel reservation system
This a hotel reservation application built by React, Spring boot and PostgreSQL. Users can sign up and log in to book their stay for their vacation.

## Description:
With a variety of hotel brands worldwide, finding and booking the perfect room for a holiday can be a challenging task, often requiring visits to numerous individual websites. To streamline this process, our project aims to develop a third-party web application, offering a centralized and user-friendly platform that aggregates rooms from various hotel brands, simplifying the search and reservation experience for users looking to find their ideal stay.
